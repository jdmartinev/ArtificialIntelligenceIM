To address the debate on\\nthe intelligence of large language models (LLMs), we propose Reflection-Bench,\\na comprehensive benchmark comprising 7 tasks spanning core cognitive functions\\ncrucial for reflection, including perception, memory, belief updating,\\ndecision-making, prediction, counterfactual thinking, and meta-reflection. We\\nevaluate the performances of 13 prominent LLMs such as OpenAI o1, GPT-4, Claude\\n3.5 Sonnet, etc. The results indicate that current LLMs still lack satisfactory\\nreflection ability. We discuss the underlying causes of these results and\\nsuggest potential avenues for future research. In conclusion, Reflection-Bench\\noffers both evaluation tools and inspiration for developing AI capable of\\nreliably interacting with the environment.
