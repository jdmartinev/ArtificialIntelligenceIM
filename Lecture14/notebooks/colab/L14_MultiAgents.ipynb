However, the complexity of\n","ontology alignments, particularly rich correspondences (c : c), makes this\n","process challenging. Existing approaches primarily focus on simple (s : s) and\n","partially complex ( s : c) alignments, thereby overlooking the challenges posed\n","by more expressive alignments. Moreover, the intricate syntax of SPARQL\n","presents a barrier for non-expert users seeking to fully exploit the knowledge\n","encapsulated in ontologies. This article proposes an innovative approach for\n","the automatic rewriting of SPARQL queries from a source ontology to a target\n","ontology, based on a user's need expressed in natural language. It leverages\n","the principles of equivalence transitivity as well as the advanced capabilities\n","of large language models such as GPT-4. By integrating these elements, this\n","approach stands out for its ability to efficiently handle complex alignments,\n","particularly (c : c) correspondences , by fully exploiting their\n","expressiveness. Additionally, it facilitates access to aligned ontologies for\n","users unfamiliar with SPARQL, providing a flexible solution for querying\n","heterogeneous data.\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Next speaker: Product_manager\n","\n","Product_manager (to chat_manager):\n","\n","The paper titled \"Enhancing SPARQL Query Rewriting for Complex Ontology Alignments\" by Anicet Lepetit Ondo, Laurence Capus, Mamadou Bousso discusses the use of GPT-4 in the context of SPARQL query rewriting. \n","\n","Potential applications in software based on this paper could include:\n","\n","1. **Semantic Web Applications**: The paper discusses using GPT-4 for rewriting SPARQL queries, which are used in the semantic web for querying data stored in RDF format. A software product could leverage this to provide more efficient or user-friendly ways to query such data.\n","\n","2. **Natural Language Interfaces for Databases**: The paper mentions the use of GPT-4 to allow users to express their needs in natural language, which are then translated into SPARQL queries. This could be used in a software product to provide a natural language interface to databases, making them more accessible to non-expert users.\n","\n","3. **Data Integration Tools**: The paper's focus on querying heterogeneous ontologies could be applied in data integration tools. These tools could use GPT-4 to help translate queries between different data sources, making it easier to integrate and work with data from diverse sources.\n","\n","4. **Knowledge Graph Applications**: The techniques discussed in the paper could be used in applications that work with knowledge graphs. These applications could use GPT-4 to improve their ability to query the knowledge graph, potentially providing more accurate or comprehensive results.\n","\n","5. **AI and Machine Learning Platforms**: Platforms that provide AI and machine learning capabilities could incorporate the techniques discussed in the paper to enhance their offerings.

However, the complexity of\\nontology alignments, particularly rich correspondences (c : c), makes this\\nprocess challenging. Existing approaches primarily focus on simple (s : s) and\\npartially complex ( s : c) alignments, thereby overlooking the challenges posed\\nby more expressive alignments. Moreover, the intricate syntax of SPARQL\\npresents a barrier for non-expert users seeking to fully exploit the knowledge\\nencapsulated in ontologies. This article proposes an innovative approach for\\nthe automatic rewriting of SPARQL queries from a source ontology to a target\\nontology, based on a user's need expressed in natural language. It leverages\\nthe principles of equivalence transitivity as well as the advanced capabilities\\nof large language models such as GPT-4. By integrating these elements, this\\napproach stands out for its ability to efficiently handle complex alignments,\\nparticularly (c : c) correspondences , by fully exploiting their\\nexpressiveness. Additionally, it facilitates access to aligned ontologies for\\nusers unfamiliar with SPARQL, providing a flexible solution for querying\\nheterogeneous data.\\n\", 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User_proxy'}, {'content': 'The paper titled \"Enhancing SPARQL Query Rewriting for Complex Ontology Alignments\" by Anicet Lepetit Ondo, Laurence Capus, Mamadou Bousso discusses the use of GPT-4 in the context of SPARQL query rewriting. \\n\\nPotential applications in software based on this paper could include:\\n\\n1. **Semantic Web Applications**: The paper discusses using GPT-4 for rewriting SPARQL queries, which are used in the semantic web for querying data stored in RDF format. A software product could leverage this to provide more efficient or user-friendly ways to query such data.\\n\\n2. **Natural Language Interfaces for Databases**: The paper mentions the use of GPT-4 to allow users to express their needs in natural language, which are then translated into SPARQL queries. This could be used in a software product to provide a natural language interface to databases, making them more accessible to non-expert users.\\n\\n3. **Data Integration Tools**: The paper\\'s focus on querying heterogeneous ontologies could be applied in data integration tools. These tools could use GPT-4 to help translate queries between different data sources, making it easier to integrate and work with data from diverse sources.\\n\\n4. **Knowledge Graph Applications**: The techniques discussed in the paper could be used in applications that work with knowledge graphs. These applications could use GPT-4 to improve their ability to query the knowledge graph, potentially providing more accurate or comprehensive results.\\n\\n5. **AI and Machine Learning Platforms**: Platforms that provide AI and machine learning capabilities could incorporate the techniques discussed in the paper to enhance their offerings.
