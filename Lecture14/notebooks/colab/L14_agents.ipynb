This is often achieved via [tool-calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).\n","\n","In this tutorial we will build an agent that can interact with a search engine. You will be able to ask this agent questions, watch it call the search tool, and have conversations with it.\n","\n","## End-to-end agent\n","\n","The code snippet below represents a fully functional agent that uses an LLM to decide which tools to use. It is equipped with a generic search tool. It has conversational memory - meaning that it can be used as a multi-turn chatbot.\n","\n","In the rest of the guide, we will walk through the individual components and what each part does - but if you want to just grab some code and get started, feel free to use this!"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -U langchain-community langgraph langchain-openai tavily-python
