# ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence Course â€“ Final Project Guidelines

This document outlines the final project requirements for the **Artificial Intelligence (AI) course**. The objective of the project is to apply AI techniques to solve a specific problem of interest, demonstrating the ability to design or implement a model, train it (if applicable), and evaluate its performance. Each team is expected to submit a short report, a recorded video, and a working implementation as evidence of their understanding and application of AI concepts covered during the course.

## ðŸ“† Important Dates

- **May 2** â€“ Submit your **project idea** (title, short description, team members)
- **June 1** â€“ **Final submission deadline**

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Requirements

- Projects must be completed in teams of **4 students**.

---

## ðŸ“„ Deliverables

Each team must submit the following:

### 1. Project Report (Max. 2 pages, PDF)

This document must include:

- **Problem Statement**  
  A brief description of the task the model addresses. Include context, objective, and dataset used (if applicable).

- **Model Architecture**  
  Describe the model used or implemented. Include layers, key components, and design decisions (e.g., CNN, transformer, etc.).

- **Training Procedure** *(only if training is involved)*  
  Include:  
  - Optimizer  
  - Learning rate  
  - Epochs  
  - Batch size  
  - Loss function  
  - Hardware used (optional)

- **Results**  
  Present key metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score), training/validation curves, and insights from the evaluation.

---

### 2. Video Presentation (Max. 10 minutes)

A short video where the team explains:

- The problem and its motivation  
- The model and how it works  
- How it was trained and tested  
- Key results  
- Lessons learned or future work

---

### 3. Code Repository (GitHub or similar)

The repo must contain:

- A clear `README.md` with instructions on how to run the code  
- Training and evaluation code  
- Any pretrained models or checkpoints (if applicable)  
- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for dependencies

---

Make sure all materials are submitted by **June 1**, 11:59 PM.
