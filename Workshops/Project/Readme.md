# ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence Course ‚Äì Final Project Guidelines

This document outlines the final project requirements for the **Artificial Intelligence (AI) course**. The objective of the project is to apply AI techniques to solve a specific problem of interest, demonstrating the ability to design or implement a model, train it (if applicable), and evaluate its performance. Each team is expected to submit a short report, a recorded video, and a working implementation as evidence of their understanding and application of AI concepts covered during the course.

## üìÜ Important Dates

- **May 9** ‚Äì Submit your **project idea**, including:  
  - A brief description of the problem  
  - A sketch of the proposed solution (e.g., model type, data to be used)  
  - Planned evaluation metrics
  
- **June 1** ‚Äì **Final submission deadline**

## üìÑ Deliverables

Each team must submit the following:

### 1. Project Report (Max. 2 pages, PDF)

This document must include:

- **Problem Statement**  
  A brief description of the task the model addresses. Include context, objective, and dataset used (if applicable).

- **Model Architecture**  
  Describe the model used or implemented. Include layers, key components, and design decisions (e.g., CNN, transformer, etc.).

- **Training Procedure** *(only if training is involved)*  
  Include:  
  - Optimizer  
  - Learning rate  
  - Epochs  
  - Batch size  
  - Loss function  
  - Hardware used (optional)

- **Results**  
  Present key metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score), training/validation curves, and insights from the evaluation.

---

### 2. Video Presentation (Max. 10 minutes)

A short video where the team explains:

- The problem and its motivation  
- The model and how it works  
- How it was trained and tested  
- Key results  
- Lessons learned or future work

---

### 3. Code Repository (GitHub or similar)

The repo must contain:

- A clear `README.md` with instructions on how to run the code  
- Training and evaluation code  
- Any pretrained models or checkpoints (if applicable)  
- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for dependencies

---

Make sure all materials are submitted by **June 1**, 11:59 PM.

## üí° Suggested Project Ideas (Optional)

Below are some suggested project topics. These are **not mandatory**, but may serve as inspiration:

### üß† Basics

- **Backpropagation in Convolutional Networks**  
  Implement a convolutional layer from scratch (forward and backward pass) and integrate it into our miniconda project.

- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**  
  Study and explain the core architecture of Vision Transformers, possibly including a minimal implementation.

### üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Processing

- **Supervised Fine-tuning of a Small Language Model (SLM)**  
  Fine-tune an SLM on a specific NLP task (e.g., classification, summarization, Q&A).

- **GPRO Fine-tuning with DeepSeek Models**  
  Explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (e.g., GPRO) on a model from the DeepSeek suite.

### üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision

- **Object Detection with YOLO**  
  Apply and adapt YOLO (You Only Look Once) to a custom dataset or use-case.

- **Segmentation with SAM2**  
  Use Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM2) to build a segmentation pipeline or explore transfer to other domains.

### üõ†Ô∏è Applications of AI

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Build a RAG system for a specific application (e.g., education, legal, healthcare).

- **Multi-Agent System for Coordination Tasks**  
  Implement a system of AI agents working together to solve a complex task (e.g., simulation, negotiation, or search and rescue).
