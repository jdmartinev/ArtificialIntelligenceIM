In this tutorial, we will try to replicate the experiments in the following paper:

We will follow the steps to replicate the experimnts using the Azure Machine Learning Workspace, however, the same instructions apply to almost all the development ecosystems that we consider in the course.

So, first create an account in [Azure for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste) using you @eafit.edu.co account
